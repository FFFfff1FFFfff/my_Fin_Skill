I'll solve this step-by-step using the FinQA reasoning framework.

## STEP 1: Understand the Question Type

This is a **percentage calculation** question. I need to find what portion (percentage) of the total noncancelable future lease commitments are due in fiscal 2019.

## STEP 2: Locate the Data

Looking at the table, I need:
- Total noncancelable future lease commitments
- Amount due in fiscal 2019

The table shows both operating leases and capital leases.

## STEP 3: Extract and Verify

**Data Point 1:** Fiscal 2019 commitments
- Operating leases 2019 = $137.4 million
- Capital leases 2019 = $0.3 million
- **Total 2019 = $137.4 + $0.3 = $137.7 million**

**Data Point 2:** Total noncancelable future lease commitments
- Operating leases total = $559.3 million (from "total noncancelable future lease commitments" row)
- Capital leases total = $0.5 million (from "total noncancelable future lease commitments" row)
- **Total commitments = $559.3 + $0.5 = $559.8 million**

**Verification:**
- Units consistent? ✓ (all in millions)
- Values reasonable? ✓ (2019 is less than total)
- Correct rows? ✓ (fiscal 2019 row and total row)

## STEP 4: Choose the Right Formula

Since the question asks for "what portion," this is a percentage calculation:

**Formula:** (Part / Total) × 100

Where:
- Part = Fiscal 2019 commitments = $137.7 million
- Total = Total commitments = $559.8 million

## STEP 5: Calculate
[Tool: execute_calculation] → Result: 24.59807073954984
Rounded (2 decimals): 24.6
Rounded (1 decimal): 24.6
**Calculation:**
- Formula: (137.7 / 559.8) × 100
- Result: 24.60%

## STEP 6: Format the Answer

The question asks for "what portion," which typically expects a percentage or decimal ratio. Given the context, I'll express this as a percentage rounded to 2 decimal places.

**Self-Check:**
- [ ] Correct time period? ✓ (fiscal 2019)
- [ ] Units consistent? ✓ (both in millions)
- [ ] Correct formula? ✓ (percentage calculation)
- [ ] Reasonable magnitude? ✓ (24.6% is reasonable for one year out of multiple years)

Question: was the five year total return of the 2019 peer group greater than the 2018 peer group?
Ground Truth: no

--- Full Reasoning Process ---
I'll solve this step-by-step using the FinQA reasoning framework.

## STEP 1: Understand the Question Type

This is a **Comparison** question asking whether one value is greater than another.
- Specifically: Is the 5-year total return of 2019 peer group > 2018 peer group?

## STEP 2: Locate the Data

I need to find the 5-year total return for both peer groups. Looking at the table:
- The data spans from 2014 (baseline = 100.00) to 2019 (end of 5-year period)
- The 5-year total return is represented by the final value in 2019

## STEP 3: Extract and Verify

**Data Point 1:** 2019 Peer Group (2019 value) = 281.09
- Location: "2019 peer group" row, "2019" column
- This represents the cumulative return starting from 100.00 in 2014

**Data Point 2:** 2018 Peer Group (2019 value) = 286.22
- Location: "2018 peer group" row, "2019" column  
- This represents the cumulative return starting from 100.00 in 2014

**Verification:**
- Both values are from the 2019 column (end of 5-year period)? ✓
- Both started at 100.00 in 2014? ✓
- Values are in reasonable range? ✓
- Units are consistent (index values)? ✓

## STEP 4: Choose the Right Formula

This is a simple comparison:
- Compare: 281.09 vs 286.22
- Determine: Is 281.09 > 286.22?

## STEP 5: Calculate

Comparison: 281.09 vs 286.22

281.09 < 286.22

Therefore, the 2019 peer group total return (281.09) is **NOT** greater than the 2018 peer group total return (286.22).

## STEP 6: Format the Answer

The question asks a yes/no question, so the answer should be "yes" or "no".

Since 281.09 is less than 286.22, the answer is "no".

Answer: no

Question: the combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns and included in non-current income taxes payable was what percent of the total ending balance as of november 28 2008?
Ground Truth: 11.0%

--- Full Reasoning Process ---
I'll solve this step-by-step using the FinQA reasoning framework.

## STEP 1: Understand the Question Type

This is a **percentage calculation** question. I need to find what percent the "combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions" represents of the "total ending balance as of November 28, 2008."

## STEP 2: Locate the Data

Looking at the provided table:
- **Ending balance as of November 28, 2008**: $139,549 (clearly stated in the last row)
- **Combined amount of accrued interest and penalties**: This is NOT provided in the table

## STEP 3: Extract and Verify

**Issue identified**: The question asks about "the combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns and included in non-current income taxes payable," but this value is not present in the provided data table.

The table shows:
- Beginning balance: $201,808
- Various increases and decreases during the year
- Ending balance: $139,549

However, there is **no mention of accrued interest and penalties** in the provided data.

## STEP 4: Analysis

Without the actual dollar amount of accrued interest and penalties, I cannot calculate the percentage. The formula would be:

**Formula**: (Accrued Interest and Penalties / Ending Balance) × 100

Where:
- Ending Balance = $139,549 ✓ (available)
- Accrued Interest and Penalties = ??? ✗ (NOT provided)

## Conclusion

The data provided is **insufficient** to answer this question. The table shows the reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits but does not include information about accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions.

To answer this question, I would need additional information stating the dollar amount of "accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns and included in non-current income taxes payable" as of November 28, 2008.

Answer: Cannot be determined from the provided data. The amount of accrued interest and penalties is not included in the table.

Question: in 2010 and 2009 , what was the total fair value in billions of assets segregated for the benefit of securities and futures brokerage customers?
Ground Truth: 68.9

--- Full Reasoning Process ---
I need to find information about the fair value of assets segregated for the benefit of securities and futures brokerage customers for 2010 and 2009.

Let me analyze the provided data:

**STEP 1: Understand the Question Type**
This is asking for a total/sum of fair values across two years (2010 and 2009) for a specific category of assets.

**STEP 2: Locate the Data**
Looking at the provided table, I can see:
- The table shows "income before income tax expense/(benefit) and extraordinary gain"
- It breaks down U.S. and non-U.S. components
- Years covered: 2010, 2009, 2008

**STEP 3: Extract and Verify**
❌ **Problem identified:** The table provided does NOT contain information about "assets segregated for the benefit of securities and futures brokerage customers."

The table only shows:
- U.S. income components
- Non-U.S. income components  
- Total income before tax

**STEP 4: Assessment**
The question asks about "fair value of assets segregated for securities and futures brokerage customers" but the data provided only contains income statement information (income before tax). These are completely different financial metrics:
- The question asks about **balance sheet items** (assets)
- The data shows **income statement items** (income before tax)

**Conclusion:**
The information needed to answer this question is NOT present in the provided data table. The table discusses income components, not segregated customer assets. To answer this question, I would need access to additional data that specifically shows the fair value of assets segregated for brokerage customers.

Answer: The data provided does not contain information about assets segregated for the benefit of securities and futures brokerage customers. The table only shows income before tax components, which is unrelated to the segregated assets figure requested in the question.

Question: what was the percentage change in the commercial mortgage loans designated for sale at fair value from 2008 to 2009
Ground Truth: -8.4%

--- Full Reasoning Process ---
I need to analyze this question carefully using the finqa-reasoning framework.

## STEP 1: Understand the Question Type

The question asks for "percentage change in the commercial mortgage loans designated for sale at fair value from 2008 to 2009"

This is a **Percentage Change** question.

## STEP 2: Locate the Data

Looking at the provided data, I see Table 15 titled "loans held for sale" with data for:
- December 31, 2012
- December 31, 2011

The question asks for data from **2008 to 2009**, but the table only shows **2012 and 2011**.

## STEP 3: Extract and Verify

**Critical Issue Identified:**
- Question asks for: 2008 to 2009 data
- Table provides: 2012 and 2011 data
- Data Point needed: "commercial mortgages at fair value" for 2008 and 2009
- Available data: "commercial mortgages at fair value" = $772M (2012) and $843M (2011)

**Verification:**
- Years requested (2008, 2009) are NOT in the table ✗
- The data provided does not contain the years needed to answer this question

## STEP 4: Assessment

The question cannot be answered with the provided data because:
1. The table only contains data for December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011
2. The question specifically asks about 2008 to 2009
3. There is no 2008 or 2009 data in the provided information

This appears to be either:
- A mismatch between the question and the data provided, OR
- The question may have an error (perhaps it should ask about 2011 to 2012?)

If I were to assume the question meant to ask about 2011 to 2012 (the years actually in the table), I could calculate:
- Commercial mortgages at fair value 2011 = $843M
- Commercial mortgages at fair value 2012 = $772M
- Percentage change = ((772 - 843) / 843) × 100 = -8.42%

However, I cannot answer the question as written because the required data for 2008 and 2009 is not provided.

Answer: Cannot be determined from the provided data. The table only contains data for 2012 and 2011, while the question asks for 2008 to 2009 data.

- Income tax benefit for 2010

## STEP 3: Extract and Verify

```
Data Point 1: Share-based compensation cost 2010 = $18.1 million (from "share-based compensation cost" row, "2010" column)
Data Point 2: Income tax benefit 2010 = $6.3 million (from "income tax benefit" row, "2010" column - shown as -6.3, but the negative indicates it's a benefit/reduction)

Verification:
- Both values from 2010 column? ✓
- Units consistent (both in millions)? ✓
- Values reasonable? ✓
```

Note: The income tax benefit is shown as -6.3 in the table, but for the percentage calculation, I'll use the absolute value of 6.3.

**Data Point 1:** Beginning balance (2007) = $201,808 (from "beginning balance as of december 1 2007" row)

**Data Point 2:** Ending balance (2008) = $139,549 (from "ending balance as of november 28 2008" row)

**Verification:**
- 2007 comes before 2008? ✓
- Both in same units (dollars)? ✓
- Values reasonable? ✓

## STEP 4: Choose the Right Formula

For percentage change:
**Formula:** `((New - Old) / Old) × 100`

Where:
- Old = 2007 value = $201,808
- New = 2008 value = $139,549

Question: what would the fair value of total securities available for sale be without the fair value of securities classified as corporate stocks as of december 31 , 2012?
Ground Truth: 61545

--- Full Reasoning Process ---
I'll solve this step-by-step using the FinQA reasoning framework.

## STEP 1: Understand the Question Type

This is a **subtraction/exclusion** question: "What would X be without Y?"
- X = Fair value of total securities available for sale
- Y = Fair value of securities classified as corporate stocks

## STEP 2: Locate the Data

Looking at the table, I need to find:
1. Fair value of total securities available for sale as of December 31, 2012
2. Fair value of corporate stocks as of December 31, 2012

From the table:
- Row: "total securities available for sale (a)"
- Column: "december 31 2012 fair value"
- Value: $51,052 million

However, I notice there's a footnote "(a)" which typically indicates additional information. The question asks about "corporate stocks" but I don't see a separate line item for corporate stocks in the provided table.

## STEP 3: Extract and Verify

**Issue identified**: The table shows "total securities available for sale" with fair value of $51,052 million, but does not show a breakdown of corporate stocks separately.

Let me check if there's information I'm missing. The question specifically asks about "securities classified as corporate stocks" which should be a component of the total securities available for sale.

**Without the corporate stocks value visible in the provided table, I cannot complete this calculation.**

However, if I assume that the corporate stocks value should be provided elsewhere in the original document (perhaps in a detailed breakdown referenced by footnote (a)), let me demonstrate the approach:

## STEP 4: Choose the Right Formula

Formula: **Total Securities AFS Fair Value - Corporate Stocks Fair Value**

## STEP 5: Calculate

Since the corporate stocks value is not provided in the visible table, I need to make a reasonable assumption. Let me check if there's a standard breakdown or if I should look for additional context.

**Wait** - Let me reconsider. Sometimes in financial documents, corporate stocks might be listed in a separate section or the value might need to be inferred. However, based solely on the table provided, I cannot see the fair value of corporate stocks.

Given that this is a specific question with an expected answer, there must be additional data not shown in the excerpt provided. Let me assume there's a value for corporate stocks that should be available (commonly this would be shown in a detailed breakdown of the securities available for sale).

If I had the corporate stocks fair value, the calculation would be:
[Tool: generate_calculation_formula] → Unable to auto-generate formula. 
Data provided: {
  "total_afs_fair_value": 51052,
  "corporate_stocks_fair_value": "unknown"
}
Please specify the operation type or provide more context.
Based on the table provided, I can see the total securities available for sale fair value is $51,052 million as of December 31, 2012. However, **the fair value of corporate stocks is not shown in the provided table excerpt**.

To answer this question properly, I would need additional information that breaks down the securities available for sale by type (including corporate stocks). This information is likely referenced by footnote "(a)" but is not included in the data provided.

**If you can provide the fair value of corporate stocks**, the calculation would be:
- Fair Value without corporate stocks = $51,052 million - [Corporate Stocks Fair Value]

Answer: Unable to determine from the provided data. The table shows total securities available for sale fair value of $51,052 million, but does not include the breakdown showing the fair value of corporate stocks component needed to complete the calculation.

Question: assuming the same level of settlements as in fiscal 2007 , what would be the ending balance at march 31 2008 in millions for unrecognized tax benefits?\\n
Ground Truth: 112

--- Full Reasoning Process ---
I'll work through this step-by-step using the FinQA reasoning framework.

## STEP 1: Understand the Question Type

This is a **hypothetical calculation** question asking: "What would the balance be IF settlements continued at the same level?"

The question asks about settlements, but I need to identify what actually changed in fiscal 2007.

## STEP 2: Locate the Data

From the reconciliation table:
- Balance at April 1, 2007: $224 thousand
- Reductions for tax positions for closing of applicable statute of limitations: -$56 thousand
- Balance at March 31, 2008: $168 thousand

The table shows the actual fiscal 2008 activity. I need to understand what happened in fiscal 2007 to establish the "same level of settlements."

## STEP 3: Extract and Verify

Looking at the data:
- **Starting balance (April 1, 2007)**: $224 thousand
- **Reduction during fiscal 2008**: $56 thousand
- **Ending balance (March 31, 2008)**: $168 thousand

The question asks about "settlements" but the table shows "reductions for tax positions for closing of the applicable statute of limitations" which is $56 thousand.

**Key insight**: The question assumes this $56 thousand reduction represents the "level of settlements" from fiscal 2007, and asks what would happen if we applied another $56 thousand reduction in fiscal 2008.

## STEP 4: Choose the Right Formula

If we assume the same level of reductions ($56 thousand) happens again:

**Formula**: New Balance = Current Ending Balance - Additional Reduction
**Formula**: New Balance = $168 - $56

## STEP 5: Calculate
[Tool: execute_calculation] → Result: 112
Calculation: $168 - $56 = $112 thousand

## STEP 6: Format the Answer

The question asks for the answer "in millions", so I need to convert:
$112 thousand = $0.112 million

However, looking at the context and typical financial reporting, the answer should be expressed as a decimal in millions: **0.112** or rounded to **0.11** million.

Question: what is the total amount of stock options cancelled in millions during 2017 , 2016 and 2015?
Ground Truth: 12.1

--- Full Reasoning Process ---
I'll analyze this question step-by-step using the FinQA reasoning framework.

## STEP 1: Understand the Question Type

The question asks: "what is the total amount of stock options cancelled in millions during 2017, 2016 and 2015?"

This is asking for information about **stock options cancelled**, which would require:
- Direct lookup of stock options cancelled data
- Potentially summing across multiple years

## STEP 2: Locate the Data

Let me carefully scan the provided data for information about "stock options cancelled."

**Scanning the text:**
- The data discusses guarantees and indemnifications
- Information about common equity and authorized shares
- Dividends declared per common share
- Share repurchase program details
- A table showing common share repurchases

**Key observation:** The table provided shows:
- Common share repurchases (in millions)
- Average cost per share
- Total cost of common share repurchases

For years 2017, 2016, and 2015.

## STEP 3: Extract and Verify

**Critical Issue:** The question asks about "stock options cancelled" but the data provided only contains information about:
1. Common share repurchases
2. Guarantees and indemnifications
3. Shareholders' equity
4. Dividends

**Verification:**
- Is there any mention of "stock options" in the text? ❌ No
- Is there any mention of "options cancelled"? ❌ No
- Is there any mention of "cancellation"? ❌ No

The table shows "common share repurchases" which is **different** from "stock options cancelled":
- Share repurchases = buying back issued shares from the market
- Stock options cancelled = cancellation of employee stock option grants

## STEP 4: Conclusion

**The data provided does not contain any information about stock options cancelled.** 

The question cannot be answered with the given data. The table shows share repurchases (29.0M, 36.6M, and 22.1M shares for 2017, 2016, and 2015 respectively), but these are NOT stock options cancelled.

Answer: The provided data does not contain information about stock options cancelled. The table shows common share repurchases, which is different from stock options cancelled. Therefore, this question cannot be answered with the given information.

I'll solve this step-by-step using the FinQA reasoning framework.

## STEP 1: Understand the Question Type

This is a **percentage change** question - specifically asking for the "percentage decrease" from 2009 to 2010.

## STEP 2: Locate the Data

Looking at the cash flows table, I need:
- The row: "cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities including discontinued operations"
- The columns: 2009 and 2010

## STEP 3: Extract and Verify

**Data Point 1:** Cash flows from operations 2009 = $559.7 million (from "operating activities" row, "2009" column)

**Data Point 2:** Cash flows from operations 2010 = $515.2 million (from "operating activities" row, "2010" column)

**Formula:** `((New - Old) / Old) × 100`

Where:
- Old = 2009 value = 559.7
- New = 2010 value = 515.2

## STEP 5: Calculate

**Substitution:** `((515.2 - 559.7) / 559.7) × 100`

**Step-by-step:**
- Change = 515.2 - 559.7 = -44.5
- Percentage = (-44.5 / 559.7) × 100
- Percentage = -0.07951... × 100
- Percentage = -7.95%

The negative sign indicates a decrease, which matches the question's expectation.

【Sample 50】
Question: for the quarter ended 12/29/2018 what was the percent of the total shares bought after 11/25/2018
Ground Truth: 32.5%

--- Full Reasoning Process ---
I'll solve this step-by-step using the finqa-reasoning framework.

## STEP 1: Understand the Question Type

This is a **percentage calculation** question asking: "What percent of total shares bought in the quarter were purchased in a specific period (after 11/25/2018)?"

## STEP 2: Locate the Data

Looking at the table for the quarter ended 12/29/2018, I need:
- Total shares purchased for the entire quarter
- Shares purchased in the period 11/25/18 to 12/29/18

## STEP 3: Extract and Verify

**Data Point 1:** Total shares purchased in the quarter = 630,000 shares
(from "total/average" row, "shares purchased" column)

**Data Point 2:** Shares purchased after 11/25/18 = 205,000 shares
(from "11/25/18 to 12/29/18" row, "shares purchased" column)

**Verification:**
- The period 11/25/18 to 12/29/18 is indeed after 11/25/2018 ✓
- Both values are in the same units (number of shares) ✓
- 205,000 < 630,000 (part is less than total) ✓

## STEP 4: Choose the Right Formula

This is a percentage calculation:
**Formula:** (Part / Total) × 100

Where:
- Part = Shares purchased after 11/25/18 = 205,000
- Total = Total shares purchased in quarter = 630,000

## STEP 5: Calculate

**Formula:** (205,000 / 630,000) × 100

**Calculation:** 
- 205,000 ÷ 630,000 = 0.32539...
- 0.32539... × 100 = 32.539...%

**Result:** 32.54% (rounded to 2 decimal places)

## STEP 6: Format the Answer

The question asks for a percent, so I'll format as a percentage.

**Self-Check:**
- [ ] Correct time period? Yes - 11/25/18 to 12/29/18 ✓
- [ ] Units consistent? Yes - both in shares ✓
- [ ] Correct formula? Yes - percentage calculation ✓
- [ ] Reasonable magnitude? Yes - 32.54% is reasonable ✓
